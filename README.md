The goal of the project is to provide robust firmware to control a SMD reflow oven.  It is a work-in-progress, and any feedback is greatly
appreciated!  This source code was developed for use on a ATMega328p or compatible AVR microcontroller, specifically a custom board I
designed.  This project should be compatible with most AVR boards, and uses the GNU AVR-GCC compiler.

The system is based around a Round-Robin OS, cycling at a frequency of 500Hz.  This project is incomplete, and is being actively developed.

Suggestions can be made through the email listed above, or directly through github.

Thanks for showing interest!
